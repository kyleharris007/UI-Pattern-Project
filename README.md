# UI-Pattern-Project - Rick and Morty

Welcome to my UI project!

For this mini project, I decided to incorporate data from the Rick and Morty API into a webpage. Here is a link to the API used for the data populating in the project - https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character

This project shows the names of a few notable characters from Rick and Morty; unfortunately, no photos are included at this time.

Play around by clicking the Characters button and watch as some of the best characters from Rick and Morty populate.
